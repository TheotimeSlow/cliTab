cliTab is a simple tab creation tool for, at the time of writing,
only EADG tuning bass.
Ukulele, other instruments and tunings are WIP.

## Usage

```bash
python3 cliTab.py
```

After choosing the instrument and tuning choose the position of the note with
the string and the fret wanted (i.e. E2 or G7)
